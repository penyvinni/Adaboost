# AdaBoost Algorithm

## Project Overview
This project focuses on the AdaBoost algorithm, a powerful machine learning technique used for improving the performance of weak learners by combining them into a strong ensemble model. It is widely applied in areas such as image classification, object detection, and bioinformatics. The repository includes a Python implementation of AdaBoost and explores its theoretical aspects.

## Introduction
AdaBoost (Adaptive Boosting) is a popular boosting algorithm introduced by Yoav Freund and Robert Schapire in 1996. It focuses on binary classification problems and has proven effective in handling complex classification and regression tasks. The algorithm iteratively adjusts the weights of training samples, allowing for improved classification accuracy by emphasizing misclassified examples.

## Core Concepts
Key concepts related to AdaBoost:
- **Weak Learners**: Simple models like shallow decision trees that perform slightly better than random guessing.
- **Weighted Data**: Training samples are assigned weights to emphasize harder-to-classify examples.
- **Boosting Process**: Weak learners are trained iteratively, and their predictions are combined to form the final output.

## Algorithm Explanation
AdaBoost follows these steps:
1. Initialize equal weights for all training samples.
2. Train a weak learner and calculate its error.
3. Update the weights based on the learner's accuracy, giving more weight to misclassified samples.
4. Combine predictions of all weak learners to form the final model.

The algorithm is particularly useful for high-dimensional datasets and can handle noisy data effectively.

## Applications
- **Image Classification**: Used in facial recognition, object detection (e.g., Viola-Jones face detector).
- **Object Detection**: Recognizing and locating objects in images using classifiers such as Histograms of Oriented Gradients (HOG).
- **Spam Filtering**: Differentiating between spam and legitimate emails.
- **Bioinformatics**: Applications include protein structure prediction and gene expression analysis.

## Python Implementation
This repository includes a Python implementation of the AdaBoost algorithm applied to a diabetes dataset.

### Example Code:
```python
from sklearn.ensemble import AdaBoostRegressor
from sklearn.datasets import load_diabetes
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split

# Load the dataset
diabetes = load_diabetes()
X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(diabetes.data, diabetes.target, test_size=0.2, random_state=42)

# Create and train the AdaBoost regressor
reg = AdaBoostRegressor(random_state=42)
reg.fit(X_train, y_train)

# Make predictions and calculate accuracy
y_pred = reg.predict(X_test)
acc = reg.score(X_test, y_test)
print(f"Accuracy: {acc}")
